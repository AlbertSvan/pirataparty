# Píratapartý

This repository contains (personal) working documents related to the
formation of a pirate party in Iceland. These documents are public,
and reflect nothing other than the personal opinion of the
author. Most of them are liable to be written in Icelandic and to have
a limited application to non-Icelandic circumstances.

Oh, and the Markdown files here are not GitHub-flavoured. They're
