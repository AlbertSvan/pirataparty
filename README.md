# Píratapartý

This repository contains (personal) working documents related to the formation
of a pirate party in Iceland. These documents are public, and reflect nothing
other than the personal opinion of the author. Most of them are liable to be
written in Icelandic and to have a limited application to non-Icelandic
circumstances.

The files are auto-wrapped at column 80. It would be *deeply* appreciated, if
you're mad enough to actually suggest changes to any of them, that you either do
no wrapping on those changes or have them at column 80 as well.

Copyright being what it is, it's always best to be explicit about these
things. *Everything* in this archive is distributed under terms of the Creative
